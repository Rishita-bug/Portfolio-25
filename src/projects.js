      description: "My graduation project done as a part of a 6 month internship at Samsung Research Institute that explores personalization with a backdrop of Galaxy AI.",
      headerImg: PersonalizationHeader,
      about: "I was graciously given the exciting opportunity to work from ground-up on a complex and relevant topic, and was allowed to organically define and redefine the brief. It’s also what made it challenging. Working solo, systematically narrowing down to deliver collaterals, and managing and documenting a 6-month project broadened my horizons. I learnt the significance of a fluid UX process that adapts to the brief, timeline, the product and the nature of users’ interaction with it.",
      brief: "Gather and leverage insights from user adoption and response to personalized experiences (physical and digital) to develop design principles and concepts for effective personalization in intelligent mobile devices to enhance everyday experiences of Millennials and Gen Z.",

      description: "A guide to help new joinees commute in and around NID Andhra Pradesh's transit campus, as a part of a welcome kit.",
      headerImg: Project2Header,
      about: "Commuting to, and in and around a transit campus in a semi-remote location was a challenge that I faced, and saw my peers and juniors (and at times visiting faculty) face as well, often leading to unnecessary unpleasant first-experiences as opposed to a smooth start. This is hence an earnest attempt at a support mechanism to help users feel welcome and confident in their first few commutes in the area. As a classroom assignment, it deepened our understanding of the UX process, especially through open-ended deliverables that pushed us to apply it across different contexts.",
      brief: "As a part of a welcome kit to be provided to new joinees, design a guide to aid in transportation in and around the NID AP's transit campus.",

      about: "Being mentored by professionals working in the industry fuelled great learning, most of all, interpreting a brief with an open and exploratory mindset, questioning the assumptions within the brief and redefining what’s being asked (what is pleasantness?). It eventually led to a fun exploration of putting animation at work, backed by in-depth, revelatory UX research.",

      headerImg: AshoreHeader,
      about: "Designing for challenge and just the right amount of friction, instead of ease was a refreshing perspective I experienced in this project. Designing for “players” vs “users” made friction fun, not a flaw. The constraint of the brief being and educational game made us push the boundaries of what it means to educate, the shift from subject/chapter-based, compartmentalised learning to real-world relevance, and the role of play in fostering awareness.",
